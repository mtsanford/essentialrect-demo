# essentialRect Demo

This website is a short demonstration of how essentialRect works.  EssentialRect is metadata that defines an essential rectangle for an image.   For software that supports it, such as this website, the essentialRect is guaranteed to be shown, with the remainer of the display area filled with the rest of the image as possible.  This allows an image to have a responsive rendering to different aspect ratios, in what is known as 'agnostic composition'.
